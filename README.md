# StudentGraphs

The student graphs project is a project what was initially created to display a report style for student demographics.
The data for this project was taken from a csv file that was also used in the StudentCSV project in my github, which can be found [here]: https://github.com/MalcolmKyle/StudentsCSV

The full project file can be found [here]: https://malcolmmccullum.com/GMT

A user can click on a button to find the final averages of four different context (internet access, past failures, study time, and absences).
Once a button is clicked, the review of the averages are shown directly below the text.
